# Movie Recommendation System by Scraping Data
This is a Jupyter Notebook that uses web scraping techniques to build a movie recommendation system based on the IMDb Top 250 movies list.

## Description
The notebook uses web scraping techniques to extract data from the IMDb website and build a movie recommendation system based on user ratings and similarity metrics. The system recommends similar movies to the user based on their input movie titles.

The notebook includes data scraping, data cleaning, data exploration, and model building. The movie recommendation system is built using a content-based filtering approach, which recommends movies that are similar to the user's input movie based on shared attributes such as genre, director, and cast.

## Installation
To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine. You can download Jupyter Notebook from the official website: https://jupyter.org/install.html
